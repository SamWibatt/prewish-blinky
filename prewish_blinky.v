/*
All right! So here's the blinky part. Do the subset of the wishbone port. Per docs, about STUDENTs, 

CLK_I
The clock input [CLK_I] coordinates all activities for the internal logic within the WISHBONE interconnect. All WISHBONE 
output signals are registered at the rising edge of [CLK_I]. All WISHBONE input signals are stable before the rising edge of [CLK_I].

DAT_I()
The data input array [DAT_I()] is used to pass binary data. The array boundaries are determined by the port size, with a 
maximum port size of 64-bits (e.g. [DAT_I(63..0)]). Also see the [DAT_O()] and [SEL_O()] signal descriptions.

RST_I
The reset input [RST_I] forces the WISHBONE interface to restart. Furthermore, all internal self-starting state machines 
will be forced into an initial state. This signal only resets the WISHBONE interface. It is not required to reset other 
parts of an IP core (although it may be used that way).

STB_I
The strobe input [STB_I], when asserted, indicates that the STUDENT is selected. A STUDENT shall respond to other WISHBONE 
signals only when this [STB_I] is asserted (except for the [RST_I] signal which should always be responded to). The 
STUDENT asserts either the [ACK_O], [ERR_O] or [RTY_O] signals in response to every assertion of the [STB_I] signal.
